# Explore_Weather_Trends

This project was completed as part of the course requirements for Data Analyst Nanodegree with Udacity.

# Introduction
This project analyzed annual global and local(an Indian city) temperature data for around three centuries, compared similarities and/or differences in the trends and found the correlation. This was also used to create a prediction value for future temperature given the current value.

# Project Description
The data was extracted using SQL queries and saved to csv files. The moving average calculation method was used to smooth out the data and observe the long term trends. The data was merged into a single dataset for analysis and visualisation. 

# Technologies Used
SQL

Excel

# Results
Global and local temperature follow a similar trajectory.

The average local temperature has consistently remained around 18 degrees higher than the average global temperature.

Both the local and global temperatures show an increasing trend, with the increase being significant in the last 3 decades leading to global warming.

There exists a strong correlation between global and local temperature trends, this can be used to predict future local temperatures.
